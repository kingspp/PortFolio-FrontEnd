The probability of each word is based on the appearance of the word in a sentence which results in the sentence being either positive or negative. The pos/neg files are constructed based on IMDB's Sentimental reviews and twitter's sentiments"))

It consists of multiple inputs and a single output. Each input is modified by a weight, which multiplies with the input value. The neuron will combine these weighted inputs and, with reference to a threshold value and activation function, use these to determine its output"))

The usage and frequency of these words predict the importance of a sentence. Hence TF-IDF algorithm is used to calculate the frequency of these words, later Probability Theory is applied to find the probability of the sentence being important"))
